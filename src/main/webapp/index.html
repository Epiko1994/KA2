            <p>Observe that the link above does NOT (yet) document your code, but the (in)famous Pet-store</p>
            <p>In your browser test these two endpoints:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>/api/openapi.json</code></li>
                <li><code>/api/openapi.yaml</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>What is returned by these two endpoints (MIME type, and what does the content represent) </p>
            <h4>TODO:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Open the file <em>index.html</em> in the folder <em>openapi</em></li>
                <li>Locate the URL that points to the external petstore-API and replace with a (relative) link to one of the two endpoints given above</li>
                <li>Refresh your browser (CTRL-F5) and click the link to the <em>API-Documentation</em> again</li>
                <li>Verify that you get documentation for your own end-points</li>

            <h2>Sprints</h2>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Sprint one</strong> (Friday 04/10 - Monday 07/10): 
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project.

                <li>The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).

                <li>The CI-pipeline must be setup

                <li>Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Sprint two</strong> (Tuesday 8/10 - Wednesday 9/10):
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Most of the Entity Classes should be ready

                <li>Sample data should be available in the dev-database

                <li>Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and integrations tests
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Sprint three </strong>(Thursday 10/10- Sunday 13/10):
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Complete the API (as much as you have time for)

                <li>Implement a simple SPA which as a minimum must have the ability to use some of your GET endpoints and at least one POST endpoint. Consider pages like: 
                    <ul>

                        <li>Get all persons with a given hobby

                        <li>Get all persons living in a given city (i.e. 2800 Lyngby)

                        <li>Get the count of people with a given hobby

                        <li>Get a list of all zip codes in Denmark

                        <li>Get a list of companies with more than xx employes

                        <li>Create a Person (with hobbies, phone, address etc.)
                        </li> 
                    </ul>
